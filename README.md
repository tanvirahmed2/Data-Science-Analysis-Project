# 🔎 Project Workflow

The project follows a standard data science lifecycle:

---

## 1️⃣ Data Collection

- Imported dataset into Python
- Inspected data structure and types
- Identified missing values and inconsistencies

---

## 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Standardised column formats
- Converted data types where necessary
- Created derived features (if applicable)

This ensured the dataset was reliable and ready for analysis.

---

## 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase focused on:

- Summary statistics
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Group-based comparisons
- Outlier detection

Key visualisations included:

- 📊 Histograms
- 📈 Line charts
- 📉 Bar plots
- 🔥 Heatmaps
- 📦 Boxplots

---

## 4️⃣ Key Insights & Findings

Through analysis, I identified:

- Major trends within the dataset
- Relationships between variables
- Factors influencing key outcomes
- Statistical patterns supported by visual evidence

These findings provide meaningful business or analytical insights based on the dataset.
